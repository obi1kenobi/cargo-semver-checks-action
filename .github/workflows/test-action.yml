name: Smoke test the action

# Assumes that the latest published normal version of `ref_slice` smaller
# than 1.2.2 is 1.2.1.
# TODO: Change the crate version in the corresponding branches `patch_change`
# and `major_change` to 1.2.1 once new logic of choosing baseline is adapted.
# Otherwise if new version 1.2.2 of `ref_slice` is released, the tests might
# stop working correctly.
